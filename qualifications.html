        <ul>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li class="qualificationsSkills"><strong>C++</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li  class="qsLi">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C++ is a language I am very familiar with. For starters, it is our main course that we are using here at Texas A&M. From learning Data Structures and Algorithms to Computer Systems through C++, I have built up a lot of confidence in the language through my courses. Alongside using it extensively here at Texas A&M, I have also made numerous amounts of projects which have been heavily dependent on C++.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li class="qualificationsSkills"><strong>Java</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="qsLi">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Java is one of the first languages I used and learned thoroughly. Being introduced to the language in high school, I proceeded to go beyond the requirements of my AP courses at the time and really take to learning the language. I did this as I believed that it would not only help me in my courses but give me an edge over others in general. I was proficient enough to where I passed a certification exam provided by Certiport and have earned the title of "IT Specialist - Java" issued through them.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li class="qualificationsSkills"><strong>Python</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="qsLi">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python is a language that I have mainly used to work with data and perform calculations and visualizations through graphs. The language is one that is quick to learn as the syntax is quite simple and does not punish you for syntaxical mistakes compared to other languages such as C++ mentioned above. Learning and creating visuals through Python was a wonderful time as I learned about many intriquicies that a "simple" syntax language may have.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li class="qualificationsSkills"><strong>SQL</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="qsLi">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SQL is one of the more recent but surprisingly fun languages that I have learned. I have used SQL to manage many databases and extract information and create queries with in practice projects as I haven't found a personal project in which I could work with this at the time of writing. Luckily for me, at the time of writing this, I am about to enter a project that involves MORE data management and is going to allow me to harness my skills in SQL and properly handle hundreds of thousands of lines of data.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li class="qualificationsSkills"><strong>HTML</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="qsLi">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML was my very first language ever. As I explained on my About Me page, I was intorduced to HTML in middle school and that is where the passion and intrigue for Computer Science really began. I was able to make my own simple websites but have never really put it into practice until now. Now as you can see, I would like to say I have learned a lot and created a clean, fun, and presentable website demonstrating who I am personally, academically and technically!</li>
                    </ul>
                <li class="qualificationsSkills"><strong>CSS</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="qsLi">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSS is my most recent language at the time of writing. Learning CSS while making this website was a pain trying to make everything how I envisioned it but I have had a great time learning it. It is also crucial to front end web development as the style of websites are crucial to keeping a user's attention, especially if you are a customer. Creating a website that is easy and clean to look at with the eye is a very important skill that I would like to say I have learned through this project!</li>

        <h1 class="qualificationsHeader">Techincal Interests</h1>

            <p class="qualificationsParagraph">
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The field of Computer Science is endless. Whatever you imagine, you can create right at your fingertips. Withit however, you tend to find some things that interest you more than others. Some of the things that interest me in Computer Science are<strong> Data and Database Management, Graphics/VR/AR as well as AI</strong> (who isn't interested in AI now).
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Data management</strong> is not something I am new too but something I am becoming much more technically proficient in at the time of writing. Taking personal time to learn the more advnaced parts of SQL has been quite fun surprisingly. Knowing how to handle, alter, display and understand data is one of if not the most important aspect in really, anything. Data allows us to run programs, understand user interactions with company websites, quantify people's interests and so much more. Being able to harness data and "bend it to your will" is one of the most powerful things you could know and something that has been a pleasure to learn and become stronger in.
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Graphics</strong> in my opinion are going to be the next big thing after AI. What I mean by graphics being the next big thing is not making a lion crystal clear on your T.V. in a nature documentary but rather immersion. Immersion done through Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality. Using Lidar Sensors to create a dimensionaly accurate 3d space in a computer and then transporting a person in it and having it feel natural with depth perception, colors and the rest while a screen is only 2 inches from your eyes is absolutely incredible to me. From trying the Meta Quest 3 to having Apple release the Apple Vision Pro, people wanting to disconnect from the real world and transfer into something different is going to be the next big thing and something that fascinates me every time I use a VR/AR headset.
                <br>
                <br>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>AI.</strong> Do I really need to say more to be honest? Creating a neural network that allows the computer to think for itself and learn from mistakes like the brain that is currently reading this is absolutely mind blowing as a concept is becoming a reality more and more. AI is going to power the future and allow the already incredibly rapid pace of technical evolution increase even more. While AI will be powerful and allow for mesmerizing things like creating photo realistic images/videos to being able to produce complete files such as the AI page on my website, I don't personally believe that it will "take over" as some may say. We as humans are who we are and go to where we are over these millions of years because we have had creative directive that only we can create. We think independently with no inputs from the world to tell us WHAT to think about at all time. Being able to have that creative aspect will always seperate us from AI and will, in my opinion, stop any robotic takeover of the world happen.
