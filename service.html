    <h1 class="serviceHeader">Food Bank</h1>

        <p class="serviceParagraph">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the many ways that I have contributed throughout my community is by volunteering at the San Antonio Food Bank. During my time at high school, I was fortunate and privileged enough to go and help feed families breakfast. Volunteering at the food bank, I learned a lot about myself as well as the world that we live in today. One of key concepts is to <strong>NEVER</strong> judge a book by it's cover. Helping and serving members of the community, the entire demographic of San Antonio was at the food bank with their food stamps only wanting a meal. Every type of person from less abled person, people who would fit in at a high end restaurant to families and veterans. Being able to how life comes at you, I learned to appreciate the things I have, appreciate the people around me and honestly appreciate every meal I have.

        <h1 class="serviceHeader">Beach Cleanup</h1>

        <p class="serviceParagraph">
            Instead of mentioning another way I have given back, I would like to discuss a way I hope to give back in the future. As a California native, beach life is a big part of the culture. Whether it's going to the beach with your friends to have fun, go surfing or whatever the case may be, you become acquainted with the beach very quickly. After going to the beach and seeing the beautful blue water and the palm trees alongside the sand, you realize what a beatufil place it is. You want to take care of it as if it is your home.

            Personally, I pick up any trash I find and make sure that myself and anyone I am with properly disposes of their belongings if they don't need it anymore. Even though I do my part and that's it. I would like to volunteer to help clean up beaches along the great Texas state coast. I find that beach ettiqute is not followed as much here in Texas and would really like to help in any way I can to protect our wild life in the ocean from dying due to our malpractice.

            According to the Sea Turtle Conservancy, over <a href="volunteerHours.jpg">1 million marine animals die early due to plastic debris in our oceans.</a> I don't know about you, but I love wildlife and nature and would like to save them as much as I can, even if it's only 1 innocent life.
