            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my time at high school, I was fortunate and privileged enough to go spend time at the San Antonio Food Bank. Volunteering at the food bank, I learned a lot about myself as well as the world that we live in today. One of key concepts is to <strong>NEVER</strong> judge a book by it's cover. Helping and serving members of the community, the entire demographic of San Antonio was at the food bank with their food stamps only wanting a meal. Every type of person from less abled person, people who would fit in at a high end restaurant to families and veterans. Being able to how life comes at you, I learned to appreciate the things I have, appreciate the people around me and honestly appreciate every meal I have.
